I don't want to know anything about you. This site is provided for information and education, not data mining.

This server is hosted on my own infrastructure and does not rely on any externally hosted assets or APIs. No analytics,
ads, or scripts of any kind are present. No persistent or session cookies are set.

The only records created by the server are default web server logs (timestamp, client IP address, browser user agent,
and requested URL). These logs do not leave the VM hosting the site and are automatically deleted after one week.
I don't even look at them unless actively debugging (rare) issues with the site.
