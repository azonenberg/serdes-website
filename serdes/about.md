# So who is this guy?

I build open souce stuff that goes fast, usually involving high speed serial data (hence the domain name).

Projects (links coming eventually) include:
* Oscilloscope software ([ngscopeclient](https://www.ngscopeclient.org/))
* Oscilloscope probes covering DC to Ku band
* Ethernet switching
* Test equipment

My [old blog](http://siliconexposed.blogspot.com/) is no longer actively updated but is linked for reference.

# Also known as...

* [@azonenberg@ioc.exchange](https://ioc.exchange/@azonenberg/)
* azonenberg (libera.chat IRC)
* [azonenberg](https://github.com/azonenberg/) on github
* I used to be @azonenberg on the bird site but no longer actively use it. If you message me there I won't see what you said unless someone tells me.
